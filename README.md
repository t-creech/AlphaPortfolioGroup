# AlphaPortfolioGroup  

This repository contains our collaborative Alpha Portfolio project.  The goal of this project is to research and develop strategies for generating alpha in investment portfolios.  Our team consists of multiple members, each contributing code in their own sub‑directory.  

## Structure  

- `/Adharsh`, `/Dev`, `/Eric`, `/Thad` – individual contributions, analysis notebooks, and strategy prototypes.  
- Common resources (data loaders, shared utilities) may live in the root or shared directories.  

## Objectives  

- Explore portfolio optimization techniques and risk management.  
- Investigate trading strategies and factor models to generate alpha.  
- Document findings and maintain a reproducible workflow.
